# Recipe Nutrition Backend API

A Laravel-based REST API that manages recipes with ingredients and preparation steps. Nutritional values for entire recipes are automatically calculated by integrating a mock external Nutrition API.

-----

## üîß Setup

1.  **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url> recipe-app
    cd recipe-app/recipe-app-backend 
    composer install
    ```
2.  **Configure Environment:**
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
    Set your database connection (e.g., `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` and `touch database/database.sqlite`).
    Add the Nutrition API credentials (from the exercise prompt, not your actual username/password):
    ```dotenv
    NUTRITION_API_USERNAME="name"
    NUTRITION_API_PASSWORD="password"
    ```
3.  **Generate Application Key & Run Migrations:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan migrate
    ```
4.  **Start the Laravel development server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or similar).

## üß™ Nutrition API Integration (Part 1)

This part confirms interaction with the external mock Nutrition API.

**Command:**

```bash
php artisan nutrition:test
```

**Functionality:**
This Artisan command performs the following:

  * Fetches and displays all existing ingredients from the external API.
  * Searches for a specific ingredient (e.g., "Apple").
  * **POSTs two new ingredients:** "Dragon Fruit" and "Jackfruit" to the external API.
  * Confirms the successful addition of the new ingredients by searching for them.

## üçΩÔ∏è Recipe API (Part 2)

These are the RESTful endpoints for managing recipes within this application.

### `POST /api/recipes`

Creates a new recipe, including its associated ingredients and steps.

**Request Body (JSON Example):**

```json
{
  "title": "Spicy Chicken Stir-fry",
  "ingredients": [
    { "name": "Chicken Breast", "quantity": 300, "unit": "grams" },
    { "name": "Broccoli",       "quantity": 200, "unit": "grams" },
    { "name": "Soy Sauce",      "quantity": 50,  "unit": "ml" }
  ],
  "steps": [
    { "description": "Cut chicken into pieces.", "order": 1 },
    { "description": "Stir-fry chicken and vegetables.", "order": 2 },
    { "description": "Add soy sauce and serve.", "order": 3 }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /api/recipes`

Returns a list of all recipe titles and their IDs.

### `GET /api/recipes/{id}`

Returns a single recipe, including its full details (title, ingredients, steps) and the **calculated total nutritional values** (carbs, fat, protein) fetched from the external Nutrition API for each ingredient.

### `DELETE /api/recipes/{id}`

Deletes a recipe and all its associated ingredients and steps.

## üí° Development Notes

  * **External API Interaction:** Laravel's `Http` facade is used to securely interact with the external Nutrition API, handling Basic Authentication. The `getNutritionData` helper method in `RecipeController` encapsulates this logic.
  * **Nutrition Calculation:** Total recipe nutrition is calculated dynamically in the `GET /api/recipes/{id}` endpoint. It iterates through the recipe's ingredients, fetches individual nutrition data from the external API, and sums them up. The quantity of each ingredient acts as a direct multiplier for its nutritional values.
  * **Database Structure:** Uses `Recipe`, `Ingredient` (for recipe-specific ingredients), and `Step` Eloquent models with defined `hasMany` and `belongsTo` relationships. `onDelete('cascade')` ensures related data is cleaned up on recipe deletion.
  * **Validation:** All incoming API requests are validated using Laravel's robust validation features.
  * **Credentials:** External API credentials are stored securely in the `.env` file and accessed via `env()`.

      * Submitted "Dragon Fruit" and "Jackfruit"
  * `Recipe`, `Ingredient`, `Step` models with migrations
  * `POST`, `GET`, `DELETE` recipe endpoints
  * Nutrition auto-calculation on recipe retrieval (`GET /api/recipes/{id}`)
  * Laravel validation, Eloquent relationships
  * Credentials in `.env`, clean structure, PSR-4 compliance

 ## üöÄ Recipe Nutrition Frontend (Angular)

This is the Angular application that provides a user interface to interact with the Backend API.

### üîß Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd recipe-app/recipe-app-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Ensure Tailwind CSS is initialized (if not already):**
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss init
    ```
    *(This creates `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` if they don't exist. Ensure `src/**/*.{html,ts}` is in `tailwind.config.js` content array, and `@tailwind` directives are in `src/styles.scss`)*
4.  **Configure API URL:**
    Verify `src/environments/environment.ts` has `apiUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api'` (or your backend's actual API URL).
5.  **Start the Angular development server:**
    ```bash
    ng serve -o
    ```
    The frontend application will open in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:4200/`.
